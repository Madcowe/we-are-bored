# SMILE Philosophy

[SMILE](smile.acronyms) is a philosophy for developing social interaction networks, most likely
via the medium of computer networks.

The core principals of SMILE are:

- Semantics are everywhere, names and structures engender meaning so choose with care and bare in mind
that what you are creating maybe used people who are not you.
- Make connections not content, networks should be designed to encourage interactions between people
rather than content that keeps people using the network.
- It is not a popularity contest, any form of search should not use any heuristics on frequency of
use, popularity or similar.
- Limit it not to a singular application, free and open data standards should be used so that anyone
can create tools to interact with the network.
- Effective tools should be designed to take as little time as possible to use, so networks and
their applications should aim to minimise time spent directly using them while maximising the real
world interactions outside of the network.

And as an aside...threads can thuck off...if an interaction involve more people then could
effectively have a conversation round a table then find a more appropriate way to represent
that communication.
